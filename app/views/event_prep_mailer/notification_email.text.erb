Hi <%= @user.name %>,

You have an event coming up on <%= @date %> at <%= @company.name %> and we're here to help you prepare. You'll get a couple emails over the next few days with that intention in mind.

For now, you can see notes on your event in hirepool at: <%= @url %>opportunity/<%= @interview.id %>?event_notes=<%= @event.id %>

Good luck!
- Nari from hirepool
