  "faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq.helpful": "Helpful?",
  "faq.question.what_is": "What is hirepool?",
  "faq.answer.what_is": "Hirepool is a free SaaS-based platform which enables you to track and organize your interviewing interactions. How many companies will you apply to? Interview at? How did the interview go? What was your candidate experience? We believe a successful job search begins and ends with structure and data-driven decisions.",
  "faq.question.match_jobs": "Does hirepool match me to jobs, or recommend them to me?",
  "faq.answer.match_jobs": "Not today. There is no shortage of places to apply for opportunities, as well as services that claim to provide you with the “perfect job match”, neither of which is our primary mission. We believe professionals have choices around which direction to take their career… but making that choice can be difficult, and getting to where you want to go can be even more difficult.",
  "faq.question.why_use": "Why should I use this on top of all the other career search stuff?",
  "faq.answer.why_use": "We get it -- you’re applying to opportunities, scheduling interviews, researching companies and people, and talking to your trusted network all at the same time. Wouldn’t it be nice to have one place where you can track and manage your job search, which helps you make confident career decisions? With hirepool, now you can. ",
  "faq.question.how_to": "How do I set up hirepool?",
  "faq.answer.how_to": "Getting set up in hirepool is simple: login > complete onboarding (in less than 60 seconds) > begin adding opportunities and optimizing your search from there.",
  "faq.question.no_resume": "Why doesn’t hirepool ask for my resume?",
  "faq.answer.no_resume": "Resume? You’re talking about a resume? We believe actions speak louder than words. Besides, we’ve never seen a hiring manager hire a piece of paper. One of our goals is to one day eliminate the need for a resume. Until then, our mission is to utilize data from the choices you make, actions you take, and people you connect with.",
  "faq.question.auto_data_entry": "Can I automagically upload job applications and interview activity?",
  "faq.answer.auto_data_entry": "Not today. We are currently working on automation solutions in and around browser plugins, calendar integration, and email forwarding for autoscheduling. That said, the automation problem is a tricky one, so we are all ears if you have any great suggestions!",
  "faq.question.what_are_ratings": "What are interview ratings?",
  "faq.answer.what_are_ratings": "Interview ratings give you the opportunity to measure an interview experience, the interviewer, the cultural values of companies you interview with in a personalized manner. The interview ratings act as an input where the output leads to more confident career decisions.",
  "faq.question.my_data": "Where does my data go?",
  "faq.answer.my_data.part_1": "Hirepool is a closed loop. Today, the only people who can view your interview activity and ratings are you, those you invite to collaborate, and the hirepool team. We have discussed using data in aggregate down the road, but agree it will never come at the cost of our users. Please refer to our ",
  "faq.answer.my_data.privacy_link": "Privacy Policy",
  "faq.answer.my_data.part_2": " and ",
  "faq.answer.my_data.tos_link": "Terms of Service",
  "faq.answer.my_data.part_3": " for additional confidence in this matter.",
  "faq.question.export_data": "Can I export my interview activity and feedback?",
  "faq.answer.export_data": "Exporting feedback is currently unavailable, but it's on our roadmap!",
  "faq.question.data_access": "What info does hirepool have access to?",
  "faq.answer.data_access.part_1": "Hirepool has access to all of your in-app activity for the sole purpose of ensuring you get the personalized guidance you deserve. At hirepool, our mission is to serve you, not to sell your information or spam you or your network. For the full explanation, please check out our ",
  "faq.answer.data_access.tos_link": "Terms of Service",
  "faq.answer.data_access.part_2": ".",
  "faq.question.invite_others": "How do I invite other people to check it out?",
  "faq.answer.invite_others.part_1": "When you begin adding opportunities, you can also begin to invite your trusted network to share their insights per opportunity. The feedback they give you is integrated automatically into your opportunity details view, so you can keep their insights and your interview feedback nicely coupled. You can also support the hirepool community by promoting the app via ",
  "faq.answer.invite_others.li_link": "LinkedIn",

  "faq.answer.invite_others.fb_link": "Facebook",
  "faq.answer.invite_others.part_4": ", or anywhere else you want to!",
  "faq.question.what_else": "What else can I do with hirepool?",
  "faq.answer.what_else": "Beyond the above-mentioned functionality, you can view your search through a geographical lens which offers estimated commute times for each opportunity from your home address. You can also select up to three opportunities and view them in a more focused comparison, to get a better understanding of how opportunities are playing out, as well as which stack up best against your original interview plan.",
  "faq.question.archive": "What does it mean to archive an opportunity?",
  "faq.answer.archive": "Currently, archive is the way you remove opportunities from your dashboard. You may choose to archive them because you never heard back after applying, you interviewed and decided not to proceed with the opportunity, you interviewed and they decided not to proceed with you, or even if you received an offer and declined it. We believe the next time you start a new search you will benefit from the ability to access, utilize, and learn from these archived opportunities. You can toggle your filter to show or hide archived opportunities.",
  "faq.question.sort_by": "From my dashboard, how does sort by rating work?",
  "faq.answer.sort_by": "Each opportunity card on your dashboard has a rating in the top left hand corner. That rating stems from the interview ratings for that opportunity. As you rate interviews, each opportunity develops an overall opportunity rating, which you can then sort by on the dashboard.",
  "faq.question.cost": "How much does it cost to use hirepool?",
  "faq.answer.cost": "Hirepool is free until further notice.",
  "faq.question.optional_data_entry": "I don't have time to enter all of this data, what should I do?",
  "faq.answer.optional_data_entry": "We have left the majority of your data entry models in a place where you can enter as much or as little as you’d like, barring a few basic limitations. Enter as much as you can; we understand until our automagical capabilities improve, this will be a hindrance. Thanks for your patience! We’re working on this now. A friendly reminder: the data you enter is repurposed to help you with your search, based on goals you’ve defined from the beginning, so there is really no reason to hold back from sharing.",
  "faq.question.collaborators_what": "What are collaborators?",
  "faq.answer.collaborators_what": "Collaborators are those in your trusted network whom you typically turn to for advice and support. For example, you might ask your parents, good friends, former coworkers, mentors... heck, some people ask their dog for advice, and that’s okay by us (as long as they have an email you can reach them with)!",
  "faq.question.collaborators_more": "Who should I ask, how often should I ask, and what’s the benefit of asking my collaborators for help?",
  "faq.answer.collaborators_more": "Ask anyone you believe can help your search. Call on as many collaborators as you feel will help your decision making, and call on a collaborator for each opportunity they can provide valuable feedback on. Collaborators should be people who care about you and your success and will help you in any way they can to improve your search.",
  "faq.question.best_use": "What is the best way to use this tool?",
  "faq.answer.best_use": "Technology is driving the rate of career change through the roof. All of us are working hard to keep up with technology, and optimize our careers along the way. Use this tool to your advantage and remember, it’s completely custom to you, your search objectives, and the activity you input, which directly impacts the output you receive. The more you put in the more you will get out of it over time.",
  "faq.question.whats_next": "What’s next for hirepool?",
  "faq.answer.whats_next": "We continue to listen to your feedback and build more. You should expect updates from Nari the Narwhal, with a deeper dive into future features.",
  "faq.question.contact_info": "Help! How can I reach you?",
  "faq.answer.contact_info.intercom": "If you’ve found a bug or have questions try our customer support line via Intercom which can be found in-app in the bottom right hand corner of any page.",
  "faq.answer.contact_info.email": "If you prefer email please do not hesitate to reach out any time for any reason to support@hirepool.io."
